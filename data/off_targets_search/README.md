# off_targets_search

Here, all data which is used to predict off-targets is stored. These files were produced using the script [../../scripts/check_offtargets.py](../../scripts/check_offtargets.py) . The description of how they were generated is documented in the code. For downstream off-target analysis, only the output file, pna_2mm_startregions.tab was used for generating the plots.
